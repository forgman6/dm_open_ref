<!------------------------->
This is the direction that the object is facing. This has
little effect unless the object\'s icon is directional. In the case of a
directional icon, this selects the corresponding orientation from the
icon file. you should use the value names instead of the values, as
`dir = NORTHEAST` is more comprehendible then `dir = 5`

An icon file with only four (cardinal) directions
makes the choice of orientation ambiguous when the true direction is a
diagonal. In that case, of the two possibilities, the one closest to the
previous orientation is displayed. Sounds complicated, but it\'s what
one would naturally expect.
